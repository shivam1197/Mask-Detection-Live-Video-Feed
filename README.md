# Mask-Detection-Live-Video-Feed


So Here i've Tried to detect the Mask whether the mask is present on the face or not.
Programming Language used here is Python.

For this Particular Task I choose These Libraries to get the desired Result.

1. TensorFlow
2. Keras
3. MobileNets
4. OpenCV

The model is accurate, and since the MobileNetV2 architecture is used, itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

It is currently working on the live camera feed of the system. With further improvements we can take these type of model and integrate them with CCTV and identify people without mask.

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
